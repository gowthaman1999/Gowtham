        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">At The Universal Internet Providers, accessible from www.universalinternetproviders.com, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by The Cable Net World and how we use it.</p>

        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us. Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the Privacy Policy Generator.</p>

        <!-- <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">universalinternetproviders.com is a collection of brands and digital platforms (such as mobile and/or TV applications) that link people with information to aid in making some of life's most crucial decisions (including "us," "we," or "our"). Allconnect, Bankrate, CNET, MYMove, BestColleges, LonelyPlanet, and The Points Guy are just a few of the brands owned by Red Ventures. The websites, apps, and products made available by Red Ventures will collectively be referred to as the "Services" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. You should examine each service's unique rule prior to using it, as certain Red Ventures services offer distinct rules regarding privacy (like our services in Brazil or Joint Ventures).</p>

        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">The categories of Personal Information that we may gather for our services are described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Additional Disclosures</h3>

        
        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">In response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, in accordance with any legal process, or to comply with applicable laws, we may share your private data with law enforcement and other government officials. Your information may be disclosed if it's required for us to defend against legal claims, establish or exercise our freedoms, or conduct an investigation into, stop, or otherwise take action about alleged illegal activity, threats to people or property, or violations of our policies.
        </p>

        
        <h3 class="title">Personal information is sold</h3>

        
        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">Your personal information is never traded, rented, or loaned to other parties. However, we may engage in activities that, depending on your privacy preferences, could be construed as a "sale" under certain laws, such as providing social media platforms, analytics providers, and advertising firms with your information from the Identifiers and Internet or network activity data sections of the above chart. For further details on your privacy choices, see the Manage Your Information part of this Policy.
        </p>

        
        <h3 class="title">Personal information preservation</h3>

        
        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">We keep your personal information for as long as it is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was obtained, to comply with legal requirements, to settle disputes, to prevent fraud, and to enforce our agreements. Your Personal Information's amount, nature, and sensitivity are taken into account, as well as the risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which it is processed, whether those purposes can be achieved through other means, and any applicable legal requirements.
        </p>

        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">Your personal information may occasionally be anonymized by us so that it cannot be used to identify you, in which case it is no longer considered personal information. After the applicable retention period has passed</p>

        
        <h3 class="title">Information gathering from young people</h3>

        
        <p class="para pt-3 pb-3" style="text-align: justify;">Our website and services are aimed at a general audience and not specifically at children because we understand how important it is to preserve children's privacy and safety. Without verifiable parental consent, we never intentionally collect information about kids, as defined by local law or regulation, under the age of 16 or otherwise. In the event that we become aware that a person under the age of 16 has supplied Personal Information through one of our websites, we will make commercially reasonable attempts to delete that information from our records.
        </p>

        
        <h3 class="title">Information Types We Gather</h3>
